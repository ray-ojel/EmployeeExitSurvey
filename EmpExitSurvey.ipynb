    "# Clean and Analyze Employee Exit Surveys\n",
    "We'll work with exit surveys from employees of the [Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_and_Training_(Queensland)) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. You can find the TAFE exit survey [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey) and the survey for the DETE [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey). We've made some slight modifications to these datasets to make them easier to work with, including changing the encoding to UTF-8 (the original ones are encoded using cp1252.)\n",
    "\n",
    "DETE Data Dictionary: \n",
    "* ID: An id used to identify the participant of the survey\n",
    "* SeparationType: The reason why the person's employment ended\n",
    "* Cease Date: The year or month the person's employment ended\n",
    "* DETE Start Date: The year the person began employment with the DETE\n",
    "\n",
    "TAFE Data Dictionary:\n",
    "* Record ID: An id used to identify the participant of the survey\n",
    "* Reason for ceasing employment: The reason why the person's employment ended\n",
    "* LengthofServiceOverall. Overall Length of Service at Institute (in years): The length of the person's employment (in years)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, our stakeholders want to know the following:\n",
    "1. Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?\n",
    "2. Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusions:\n",
    "1. On average, established and veteran employees tend to resign due to job dissatisfaction more than New and Experiences employees. This could be due to the fact that they have other options unlike New employees who may not have as many opportunities to change their job. \n",
    "2. On averge, older employees tend to resign due to job dissatisfaction more than young employees. This could be due to the fact that they have more experience and thus more options unlike New employees who may not have as many opportunities to change their job because they're young and without much experience."
